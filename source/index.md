[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join-Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/simplethings/SimpSpector?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simpspector/simpspector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simpspector/simpspector)

What is **SimpSpector** all about?

Improving and analyzing code quality for php projects.

Features include

* enforce coding standards, where appropriate
* enable developers to configure their own rules
    * comments that trigger warnings
    * forbidden functions (e.g. var_dump)
    * ...
* support developers in fixing these issues quickly
* help developers to identify new issues arrising from merge requests currently under review
* integrate with github, gitlabs and other social open source platforms

## Not invented here

What we are doing here is hardly unique. We just needed a solution that is not SaaS and would be easily extendable and also integrates with GitLab out of the box.

Great things are already done in this area by

* SensioLabs Insight
* Scrutinizer
* Code Climate
* and many others
